# This configuration file is read by the start-memcached script provided as
# part of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.

# Run memcached as a daemon. This command is implied, and is not needed for the
# daemon to run. See the README.Debian that comes with this package for more
# information.

# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much
# memory
-m {{ openio_memcached_cachesize_MBytes }}

# Default connection port is 11211

# Run the daemon as root. The start-memcached will default to running as root if no
# -u command is present in this config file
-u {{ openio_memcached_user }}

# Specify which IP address to listen on. The default is to listen on all IP addresses
# This parameter is one of the only security measures that memcached has, so make sure
# it's listening on a firewalled interface.

# Return error when memory is exhausted (rather than removing items)
# -M

# Maximize core file limit

# modifies the UDP port, defaulting to on. UDP is useful for fetching or setting
# small items, not as useful for manipulating large items. Setting this to 0 will
# disable it, if you're worried.
